## Introduction ##

This project arises as an alternative to the creation of web services.

<span id="Dependencies"></span>
## Dependencies ##

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org).
- Python (https://www.python.org).
- XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html).
- Execute "npm i grunt -g" on the console of your operating system.
- Execute "npm i install-here -g" on the console of your operating system.

<span id="Starting"></span>
## Starting ##

In principle, don't forget to open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start the "Apache" and "MySQL" services. Now we will create a folder called "mybackend" in the path of the "XAMPP" file, which would be with the following path "../xampp/htdocs/mybackend". With the folder ready, we can now access it using the console of your operating system and execute the following command, which brings all the files from the "jsonphp" project.

***install-here jsonphp***

Now we will execute the following commands that bring all the dependencies of the "jsonphp" project.

***npm i***
***composer install***
